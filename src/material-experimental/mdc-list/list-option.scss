// The internal checkbox is purely decorative, but because it's an `input`, the user can still
// focus it by tabbing or clicking. Furthermore, `mat-list-option` has the `option` role which
// doesn't allow a nested `input`. We use `display: none` both to remove it from the tab order
// and to prevent focus from reaching it through the screen reader's forms mode. Ideally we'd
// remove the `input` completely, but we can't because MDC uses a `:checked` selector to
// toggle the selected styles.
